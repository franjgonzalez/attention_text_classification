# Front-end Software Developer Problem

## Requirements

For this exercise you will be creating a web app, intended to run in the browser,
which displays call data from `data/calls-50.json`.

You may use any number of libraries or frameworks (or none). Assume there is a backend service that returns this JSON, you may stub it out
or hardcode this data however you wish.

Please create an app that does the following:

1. Displays the list of calls.
1. When a call from the list is clicked on, display the data for this call.
   1.  This display may be visual, text, graphical, or any other way you think best presents the information.
1. Use responsive design

(Keep in mind we will be extending this exercise for your in-person interview)

We are aware this is a rather open-ended exercise
and could demand significant time.
Our goal is to see how you think,
structure an app,
write docs,
choose a tech stack,
and make a handful of design decisions.
It is difficult to gauge, but we guess this exercise will take 3-6 hours.
Consider it the first interview.
We will be extending it and refactoring it with you during the second, in-person, interview.

The requirements are intended to be sparse - you may ask us any clarifying questions
you wish, or, following the instructions in the [top-level README](../README.md),
simply declare your assumptions in the `OVERVIEW.md` markdown you include.
